# linear_skip
Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a [skip list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list "skip list").

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.
- Prototype : `skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value);`
- Where `list` is a pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
- A node of the express lane is placed every index which is a multiple of the square root of the size of the list (see example below)
- And `value` is the value to search for
- You can assume that `list` will be sorted in ascending order
- Your function must return a pointer on the first node where `value` is located
- If `value` is not present in `list` or if `head` is `NULL`, your function must return `NULL`
- Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

NOTE: [You can find here](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x0E.Linear_search-in_skip_list "You can find here") the functions used in the example. You don’t need to push them, we will compile your file with our own implementation during the correction. BUT, **don’t forget to push** `search.h`
